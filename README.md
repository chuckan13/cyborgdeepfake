Source code and datasets inspired by Siarohin et al.'s open source code @ https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model

As a personal project, I have tried to modify their code to work better. For example, the starting frame of the driving video and the source image have to align perfectly, otherwise the results are going to be very poor and unconvincing. I attempted to create a keypoint alignment algorithm where you could input a whole library of source images and the keypoing alignment algorithm would find the image that best aligns with the driving video and use that as the source image. This should theoretically improve results and be more conveninent in terms of real-world application. However, I was unable to find a lot of success with my algorithm and it resulted in worse results than the original. Thus, for the submissions of this project, I have simply reverted the code back to the original open source version that Siarohin et al. posted.
